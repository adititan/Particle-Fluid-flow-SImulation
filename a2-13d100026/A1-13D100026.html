	<body><p>Q2. Now consider a set of tracer points starting at x=-2 (consider a line with say 10 points between y=-2 to 2).  Find the trajectory of these tracer points by integrating them given the velocity of the points.  Use both an Euler integrator and a Runge-Kutta second order to study the results.</p></body>

	<body><p>Q3. Consider the motion of two point vortices in isolation.  Consider two vortices of the same sign and strength = 2*pi.  Place them a unit distance apart.  Integrate the motion of these vortices in time and use the exact solution to test your implementation of the integrator.  Test the implementation of Euler and RK2 with this.  Study the convergence of the two integrators as you reduce the timestep used for the integrator. </p></body>
